AppsForX WordPress plugin
========

This is a WordPress plugin which enables event organizers to manage their events.
People can submit ideas to these events.

Example: OKFN Belgium organized a hackathon. This hackathon had a jury and awards that were offered to the participants. 
People were able to submit ideas for this hackathon, like a "GitHub Livefeed". 
The plugin should then be able to handle the aspects of adding/editing/submitting ideas and events.

This plugin aims to be conform the [Apps4X](https://github.com/mmlab/apps4eu-vocabulary/) ontology.
It was built for the [Apps for Europe](http://appsforeurope.eu/) project.
