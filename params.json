{"name":"Appsforx","tagline":"A WordPress plug-in for event organizers","body":"AppsForX WordPress plugin\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is a WordPress plugin which enables event organizers to manage their events.\r\nPeople can submit ideas to these events.\r\n\r\nExample: OKFN Belgium organized a hackathon. This hackathon had a jury and awards that were offered to the participants. \r\nPeople were able to submit ideas for this hackathon, like a \"GitHub Livefeed\". \r\nThe plugin should then be able to handle the aspects of adding/editing/submitting ideas and events.\r\n\r\nThis plugin aims to be conform the [apps4eu](https://github.com/mmlab/apps4eu-vocabulary/) ontology.\r\nThis means that the publicly viewable pages using this plugin will contain the corresponding RDFa tags for the vocabulary.\r\nIt was built for the [Apps for Europe](http://appsforeurope.eu/) project.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n\r\nYour server might vaporize if these minimum requirements aren't met:\r\n * PHP >= 5.4 (might change in the future to have PHP 5.3 compat)\r\n * WordPress >= 3.5\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\nTo use the plugin, follow these steps:\r\n * (Recursively!) clone the repository because it has other submodules linked in.\r\n * Move the plugin/ folder inside your wp-content/plugins/ directory. \r\n * In the administration area of your WordPress site, go to the Plugins section and activate the plugin.\r\n * Create pages and assign the AppsForX page templates to them where you want the event list to be shown.\r\n   ![Event list](http://i.imgur.com/ye9YOQc.png)\r\n * If you want users to be able to submit ideas/apps, give them at least the \"Submitter\" role.\r\n   You may want to enable open user registration as well. You can find these parameters under Settings > General.\r\n   ![Submitter role](http://i.imgur.com/btTboFA.png)\r\n\r\n#### Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that your wp-content/* folders are properly chmodded. \r\nYour themes directory has to be writable for this plugin to work.\r\n\r\nDownloading the ZIP file won't work! GitHub doesn't automatically include the submodules.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCopyright: OKFN Belgium (some rights reserved)  \r\nLicense: GPL2\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2, as \r\n    published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n  \r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
